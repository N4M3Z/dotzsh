zsh-core â€” A Zsh Framework
==========================

This project is forked from the famous [Prezto][2] framework for [Zsh][1] shell.
The goals of this framework remain the same: to enrich the command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes.
The difference is in approach to some aspects of the framework.

- While most [Prezto][2] modules are small, I prefer to separate aliases, functions and key bindings from the plugin initialization completely. Hence, [zsh-core][5] automatically loads `init.zsh`, `aliases.zsh`, `bindings.zsh`, `functions.zsh` if found. [Prezto][2] authors consider such abstractions unnecessary. This behaviour is introduced in branch [enhance/modular][7], feel free to try it out.

- I prefer a different commenting style. There is limited support for [Doxygen][8] provided via [bash-doxygen][9] and for it is my personal prefernce to adhere to this standard.

See also the discussion here at [#860][5]

Apart from modifying [Prezto][2] modules to adhere to the new modular approach, [zsh-core][5] introduces support for new modules. I might eventually try to send a pull request back to [Prezto][2], I might not.

The master branch of [zsh-core][5] currently mirrors [Prezto][2], checkout [developer](https://github.com/N4M3Z/zsh-core/tree/developer) branch instead, to check out all the modifications. A comprehensive list of differences w.r.t. [Prezto][2] follows:

Alternatives
------------
While I fully encourage you to try [zsh-core][5], it should be pointed out that a single developer cannot realistically compete with community-driven frameworks. Hence, I recommend you to try the famous frameworks first and determine whether you would prefer a different approach. Follow what the author of [Prezto][2] said himself: "Use what you need; ignore the rest."

- [Prezto][2]: The source of this fork, an excellent fully modular [Zsh][1] framework with rigid code standards.

- [Oh-My-Zsh][3]: The wild wild west of [Zsh][1] plugins, probably the most extensive plugin library at the expense of source control.

- [zgen][4]: A lightweight plugin manager for [Zsh][1] that implements automatic loading and downloading of modules directly from [GitHub][4].

Don't misunderstand however, any help is always appreciated.

Installation
------------

Installation follows the same steps given in [Prezto][2] documentation. It will work with any recent release of Zsh, but the minimum required version is 4.3.17.

  1. Launch Zsh:

        zsh

  2. Clone the repository:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

  3. Create a new Zsh configuration by copying the Zsh configuration files
     provided:

        setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
        for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N); do
          ln -s "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
        done

  4. Set Zsh as your default shell:

        chsh -s /bin/zsh

  5. Open a new Zsh terminal window or tab.

### Troubleshooting

If you are not able to find certain commands after switching to *Prezto*,
modify the `PATH` variable in *~/.zprofile* then open a new Zsh terminal
window or tab.

Updating
--------

Pull the latest changes and update submodules.

    git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive

Usage
-----

Prezto has many features disabled by default. Read the source code and
accompanying README files to learn of what is available.

### Modules

  1. Browse */modules* to see what is available.
  2. Load the modules you need in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.

### Themes

  1. For a list of themes, type `prompt -l`.
  2. To preview a theme, type `prompt -p name`.
  3. Load the theme you like in *~/.zpreztorc* then open a new Zsh terminal
     window or tab.
