Composure
=========

[Composure][1] is a set of functions that make programming the shell easier and more intuitive by allowing you to:

- Transition organically from command, to function, to script
- Use an unobtrusive help system with arbitrary shell metadata
- Automatically version and store your shell functions with Git

This module simply loads [Composure][1], see this [usage example][2] to learn more on how to use it.
